<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We consider arrow logics (i.e., propositional multi-modal logics
having three - a dyadic, a monadic, and a constant - 
modal operators) augmented with various kinds of
infinite counting modalities, such as `much more', `of good quantity',
`many times'. It is shown that the addition of these modal
operators to weakly associative arrow logic results in finitely
axiomatizable and decidable logics, which fail to have the finite base
property.</P>
