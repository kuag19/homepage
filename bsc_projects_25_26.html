<b>[AK01] Finite state machines - educational tools.</b>
<br>
The centre of this project is the design and development of educational
tools dealing with finite automata, regular expressions and Turing
machines. There are 5 different projects for 5 students in this topic:

<ul>
<li> <b>(1) Animated interactive visual toolkit for finite deterministic and
  non-deterministic automata.</b> <br>
The aim of this project is to design and develop an animated interactive visual
toolkit for basic features of finite automata, such as an animated
  interactive visual simulator for deterministic/non-deterministic
  automata, and an interactive visual implementation of the
Subset Construction (that turns a non-deterministic automaton to an equivalent
deterministic one). The user-friendly GUI should be suitable for beginners in the area.
The suggested implementation language is JAVA or C++, but other high level languages
  would also be possible.</li>

</li><b> (2) Animated interactive visual toolkit for pushdown automata.</b> <br>
The centre of this project is the design and development of an
animated interactive visual simulator for pushdown automata, together with a GUI
suitable for using the simulator as an educational tool for
beginners. The suggested implementation language is JAVA or C++, but
other high level languages would also be possible. A collection of
good test-examples should also be constructed.</li>

<li><b> (3) Implementing algorithms connecting finite automata and
regular expressions.</b> <br>
The aim of this project is to implement an animated interactive visual toolkit for the two algorithms connecting a finite automaton and the regular expression representing its language. The suggested implementation language is JAVA or C++, but other high level languages would also be possible. A friendly user interface, and creating collections of finite automata and regular expressions facilitating extensive testing would also be required.</li>

<li><b> (4) Implementing equivalence-testing and state minimisation
algorithms.</b> <br>
The aim of this project is to understand, implement and compare several algorithms that determine whether two finite automata are equivalent or not. Modifications
of these algorithms should also be used turn a deterministic finite automaton to an equivalent one having a minimal number of states.
The suggested implementation language is JAVA or C++, but other high
level languages would also be possible. An important part of the
project is an example-generator facilitating systematic large-input
testing
(kind of experimentally showing the known worst-case complexity of the
various algorithms).
Extensive visuals are not needed, but a
friendly and informative user interface is necessary.</li>

<li><b> (5) Animated interactive visual toolkit for Turing machines.</b> <br>
The centre of this project is the design and development of an
animated interactive visual simulator for various versions of Turing Machines,
together with a GUI suitable for using the simulator as an educational
tool for beginners. The suggested implementation language is JAVA or
C++, but other high level languages would also be possible. A
collection of good test-examples should also be constructed.</li>
</ul>

The version numbers allocated by the system do not matter. After
allocation, I'll ask your preference-list about the versions, and will try to negotiate with everybody in the team
about who gets which one of (1)-(5). Of course, I'll try to accommodate
everybody's wishes, but sometimes it might be necessary to
choose in random. We will agree as a team, until everybody is
(reasonably) happy.

  <b>[AK02] Personal discrete-maths tutor.</b>
  <br>
  The centre of this project is the design and development of <span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>interactive</b></span> apps
(for Android/iOS or web app) with <span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>loads of visuals</b></span> that can assist revision of
  selected topics in discrete maths and logic modules (like FC1/FC2/ELA and possibly
beyond).
It would also be possible to develop standalone <span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>interactive  visual</b></span>
tools for notions and algorithms.
There are 5 different projects for 5 students in this topic. Each of the 5 project-versions will need to cover different areas of discrete maths/logic. 
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>Any</b></span> area/topic within discrete maths and logic might be suitable, but it
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>MUST be different from the tasks in
  [AK01].</b></span> 

<br><br>
After allocation, I'll ask you to do some quick research and thinking
 <span style="color: #0000ff;"><b>yourself</b></span>, and then
suggest a preference-list of the particular area(s) you may want to
cover, together with a draft list of potential functionalities of your app.
We will agree as a team about who does what, until everybody is
(reasonably) happy. However, if some area is particularly popular, it might be
necessary to choose in random who covers it.

  <b>[AK03] Your own idea.</b>
<br>
I am happy to supervise a project based on your own ideas, if I judge it to be of suitable level. Please email me a description of your project proposal. There are 5 different projects for 5 students in this topic.
