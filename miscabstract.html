<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We show that in many cases the decision problems for varieties of cylindric
algebras are much harder that those for the corresponding relation algebra
reducts. We also give examples of varieties of cylindric and relation algebras
which are algorithmically more complicated than the subvarieties of their
representable algebras.</P>
